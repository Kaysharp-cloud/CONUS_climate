# CONUS Hydroclimate Workflow

This folder is the GitHub-ready version of the `climate_100yr` project for the manuscript on baseline-dependent hydroclimatic dryness and wetness across the contiguous United States.


## Folders

- `data/`: station metadata, including the station list used for downloads.
- `scripts/`: notebooks and scripts used for preprocessing, climate indices, tables, figures, and spatial mapping.
- `data_raw/`: local source and processed CSV inputs needed by the workflow.


## Key inputs

- NOAA daily climate summaries: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets
- NEON domains shapefile: https://www.neonscience.org/sites/default/files/NEONDomains_2024.zip
